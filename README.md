# osx-plist-finder
An OS X Automator workflow that locates the preferences plist for OS X Applications

## Usage
Highlight an OS X application in Finder - typically in the /Applications folder - right-click, and select __findPlist__ from the Services menu. If the preferences plist can be found in the User Preferences location (~/Library/Preferences), it will be revealed in a Finder window.

## Installation
WIP

## Operation
WIP

## Known Limitations
 * Currently the only preferences location explored is User Preferences (~/Library/Preferences).
 * If a preferences plist file cannot be found, there is no messaging and no Finder window. The failure is silent.
